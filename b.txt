Stretching for over 2,300 kilometers (1,400 mi) off the coast of Queensland, Australia, lies Coral Paradise, the world's most extensive coral reef system. Encompassing over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands, this underwater wonderland covers a staggering 344,400 square kilometers (133,000 sq mi) in the Coral Sea. Visible from outer space, Coral Paradise is the largest single structure made by living organisms on Earth. Billions of tiny coral polyps, the real architects of this marvel, form the reef's foundation.  This vibrant ecosystem boasts a captivating diversity of life, earning its designation as a World Heritage Site in 1981.  Even CNN recognizes its grandeur, listing it among the seven natural wonders of the world.

Just like many other natural wonders, Coral Paradise faces significant challenges. Climate change, pollution, and human activities pose a serious threat to its existence.  Rising sea temperatures, a consequence of global warming, trigger coral bleaching. This phenomenon forces coral polyps to expel the algae living symbiotically within them, causing them to turn white and ultimately perish.
